    Divine_Liturgy.html

The front end will ask the userr to select a month
The app will render the Html files for the selected month from
both the fix-date and for the movable date folder and render them cronologically

When adding a new fix-date feats use the rtf billingual service file provided by the 
Antioch Archdiocese:
1 make it docx 
2 extend the content left and right
3 add the related links to the Google Drive
4 save it as html with the following naming convention: 
5 edit and replace the links adding target="_blank" to always open in new tab

If a template is used to open this file, the template should be html of only one version and should
refer the folder file directly in the hyperlink as ./<file-name> and tager="_blank"

Example: Divine_Liturgy.html refers to Divine_Liturgy_Variables with a direct link

Exverytime a file gets added, it should be added into the data/feasts.json file as follows:

[
  {
    "date": "2026-01-06",
    "type": "fixed",
    "title": "Divine Liturgy",
    "file": "Service_Texts/fixed/01/06/Divine_Liturgy.html"
  },
  {
    "date": "2026-01-06",
    "type": "fixed",
    "title": "Vespers",
    "file": "Service_Texts/fixed/01/06/Vespers.html"
  },
  {
    "date": "2026-01-11",
    "type": "movable",
    "title": "Divine Liturgy",
    "file": "Service_Texts/movable/2026/01/11/Divine_Liturgy.html"
  }
]

When front end is listing a selected month January for example and the current year is 2026, the app will read the feats.json file and will display:
  January 06, Divine Liturgy
  January 06, Vespers
  January 06, Orthros
  January 11, Divine Liturgy
  January 11, Vespers
  January 11, Orthros
